XOS LTSB is a custom ISO project built for gamers based on the 1607 LTSB version of Windows.
This modified operating system not only improves your gaming performance but also respects your privacy and is largely free of the telemetry elements that come with Windows.
Unfortunately, the project still doesn't provide a reliable environment for inexperienced users. I continue to make improvements with each version for better compatibility.
If you find it difficult to troubleshoot and install drivers on your own etc, XOS may not be for you at the moment.
Always have a backup USB with a stock Windows installation image inside in case of BSOD or faulty installation.

Read release notes before downloading to see what is missing on the ISO.

# 1607 Doesn't support GTX16xx series, RTX series and AMD6400/6500XT/6600/6600XT cards!
# 1607 Doesn't support FACEIT anymore!
